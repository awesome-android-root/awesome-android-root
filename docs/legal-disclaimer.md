# Legal Disclaimer & Safety Notice

**Last Updated:** October 2025

## Important Notice

This website provides educational information about Android rooting, system modification, and related technologies. **Please read this disclaimer carefully before proceeding.**

---

- Compatibility with your device or Android version

### Use at Your Own Risk

**You assume all risks** associated with rooting your device, including but not limited to:

- **Device damage** (bricking, hardware failure)
- **Data loss** (complete or partial)
- **Warranty void** (manufacturer warranty termination)
- **Security vulnerabilities** (if misconfigured)
- **System instability** (crashes, bootloops)

## Warranty Implications

### Manufacturer Warranty

**Rooting typically voids your manufacturer warranty.**

#### By Manufacturer:

| Manufacturer | Warranty Status After Root | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Samsung** | ❌ Void + Knox trips permanently | Knox EFUSE triggers on bootloader unlock; warranty void even if unrooted later |
| **Google** | ❌ Void | Warranty explicitly void with unlocked bootloader |
| **Xiaomi** | ❌ Void | Warranty void after unlock; official unlock program acknowledges this |
| **OnePlus** | ❌ Void | Warranty void with bootloader unlock |
| **Motorola** | ❌ Void | Warranty terminated upon unlock |
| **Nothing** | ❌ Void | Warranty void with bootloader unlock |
| **Sony** | ❌ Void + Camera quality affected | DRM keys lost permanently on unlock |
| **ASUS** | ⚠️ Varies | Some models void, check specific model policy |
| **Other brands** | ❌ Generally void | Assume warranty void unless explicitly stated otherwise |

#### What This Means:

- **Hardware issues** may not be covered even if unrelated to rooting
- **Software issues** definitely not covered
- **Re-locking bootloader** may not restore warranty (especially Samsung Knox)
- **Service centers** may refuse repairs or charge more

### Regional Differences

#### United States
- Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act provides some protection
- Manufacturer must prove modification caused the issue
- In practice, rooting still typically voids warranty

#### European Union
- Consumer protection laws stronger than US
- Warranty may still apply for unrelated hardware issues
- Burden of proof on manufacturer to show modification caused issue

#### Other Regions
- Laws vary significantly
- Check local consumer protection regulations
- Generally, expect warranty void

---

## Legal Considerations by Region

### Copyright and DMCA (United States)

**Rooting itself is legal** under DMCA exemptions for interoperability, but:

- **DRM circumvention** may violate DMCA if used to access protected content
- **Piracy** is illegal (using root for pirated apps/content)
- **Terms of Service** violations may have consequences (account bans, etc.)

### European Union

- **Right to repair** generally supports user modifications
- **Copyright laws** still apply (don't use root for piracy)
- **GDPR** - you're responsible for data protection on rooted device

### Other Regions

- **China** - Rooting generally legal, gray area for some modifications
- **India** - Legal to root, but warranty void
- **Australia** - Rooting legal under consumer rights, but warranty implications apply
- **Canada** - Similar to US (legal but warranty considerations)

**Consult local laws** if uncertain about your region.

---

## Security and Privacy Considerations

### Security Risks

**Rooting can expose security risks if misused:**

#### Increased Attack Surface
- Root access bypasses Android security model
- Malicious apps can gain superuser access
- System integrity checks defeated

#### Your Responsibilities:
- **Grant root access carefully** - only to trusted apps
- **Keep root hidden** from most apps
- **Use security modules** (firewalls, permission managers)
- **Regular backups** in case of compromise
- **Stay updated** on security patches

### Banking and Financial Apps

**Many financial apps detect and refuse to run on rooted devices:**

- Google Wallet / Google Pay
- Banking apps (varies by bank)
- Payment apps (PayPal, Venmo, etc.)
- Stock trading apps
- Cryptocurrency wallets

**Even with hiding methods, detection is improving** (Play Integrity). Consider if losing these apps is acceptable.

### Enterprise and Work Apps

**Corporate apps often detect root:**

- MDM (Mobile Device Management) apps
- Work email/calendar apps
- VPN clients
- Corporate messaging

**May result in:**
- Access revocation
- Policy violations
- Employment consequences

**Check your company's BYOD policy before rooting a work device.**

---

## Data Loss and Backup

### Bootloader Unlock Wipes Data

**Unlocking bootloader ALWAYS wipes data on:**
- Google Pixel
- Most modern devices

**Process:**
1. Backup everything important
2. Export app data where possible
3. Unlock bootloader (wipes device)
4. Restore data after rooting

### Root Operations Can Fail

**Failures may result in:**
- **Bootloop** (device won't boot)
- **Soft brick** (recoverable with firmware flash)
- **Hard brick** (device completely dead - rare but possible)
- **Partial data loss** (some apps, settings)

**ALWAYS backup before:**
- Rooting for first time
- Installing new modules
- Updating root method
- Modifying system files

---

## App and Module Risks

### Third-Party Apps and Modules

**We list apps/modules for informational purposes only.**

#### Not All Are Equally Safe:
- **FOSS (Open Source)** - Generally more trustworthy (code auditable)
- **Proprietary** - Less transparency, trust required
- **Abandoned projects** - May have unpatched vulnerabilities
- **Unknown developers** - Higher risk

#### Your Responsibilities:
- **Research before installing** anything
- **Read module descriptions** carefully
- **Check recent reviews** and feedback
- **Test one module at a time**
- **Only use trusted sources** (official repos, GitHub, F-Droid)

### Module Conflicts

**Multiple modules can conflict:**
- Cause bootloops
- Break system functions
- Degrade performance
- Create security holes

**Best practices:**
- Install modules one at a time
- Test thoroughly before adding more
- Keep backups before installing
- Document what you've installed

---

## OTA Updates and System Stability

### Over-The-Air (OTA) Updates

**Rooted devices often break OTA updates:**

| Root Method | OTA Compatibility |
|:---|:---|
| **Magisk** | Partial - requires uninstall/reinstall |
| **KernelSU** | Difficult - kernel flashing needed |
| **APatch** | Partial - depends on implementation |

**Failed OTA can result in:**
- Bootloop
- Lost root access
- System corruption
- Need to reflash firmware

### Custom ROMs

**Custom ROMs have different stability profiles:**
- **Official builds** - Generally stable
- **Unofficial builds** - Varies widely
- **Alpha/Beta builds** - Expect bugs
- **Abandoned ROMs** - Security risk

---

## Children and Parental Control

**Rooting can bypass parental controls:**

- Family Link can be circumvented
- Screen time limits can be disabled
- Content filters can be removed
- Location tracking can be spoofed

**If device is used by children:**
- Consider not rooting
- Or use strict root permissions management
- Educate about responsible use

---

## Device Resale and Trade-In

### Impact on Resale Value

**Rooted devices:**
- ✅ May be worth more to enthusiasts
- ❌ Generally worth less on mainstream market
- ❌ Trade-in programs may reject rooted devices
- ⚠️ Knox-tripped Samsung devices have reduced value

### Before Selling

**Unroot properly:**
1. Complete uninstall of root
2. Flash stock firmware
3. Factory reset
4. Re-lock bootloader if possible
5. Verify no root remnants

**Note:** Samsung Knox cannot be reset once tripped.

---

## Criminal Activity

**Using root for illegal activities is prohibited:**

❌ **Never use root for:**
- Software piracy
- DRM circumvention for piracy
- Hacking/unauthorized access
- Fraud or financial crimes
- Circumventing app purchase verification
- Cheating in online games (violates ToS)
- Stalking/spying via modified apps

**We do not condone or support illegal use of rooting.**
