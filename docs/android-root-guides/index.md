## Understanding Root Access

Root access grants **superuser (administrator) privileges** on Android, providing complete control over your device's operating system and hardware.

### What Root Enables

- **System-level control** over files, processes, and hardware
- **Bypass manufacturer restrictions**
- **Install powerful apps** requiring deep system integration
- **Modify core system files**
- **Access hidden hardware features**

### Benefits vs Risks

| Benefits | Risks |
|----------|-------|
| Complete device control | Warranty void (usually permanent) |
| System-wide ad blocking | Reduced security if misconfigured |
| Performance tuning | Banking apps may fail |
| Privacy enhancements | OTA updates blocked |
| Bloatware removal | Potential for device bricking |
| Full app backups | SafetyNet/Play Integrity issues |

### Is Rooting Right for You?

| **✅ Root If:** | **❌ Don't Root If:** |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Want complete control | Rely on banking apps |
| Ad blocking is priority | Uncomfortable with risks |
| Enjoy customization | Need warranty coverage |
| Privacy matters | Want automatic OTA updates |
| Have backup plan | New to Android mods |
| Use as daily driver | Prefer stock experience |

---

## Prerequisites and Safety

### Critical Warnings

::: danger ⚠️ PERMANENT CONSEQUENCES
**Data Loss** - Unlocking bootloader completely erases all device data. Backup everything before proceeding.

**Warranty Void** - Bootloader unlocking permanently voids manufacturer warranty on most devices.

**Security Risks** - Root access can expose your device to malware if misused. Only grant root to trusted apps.

**Banking Apps** - Many financial apps detect and refuse to run on rooted devices.

**Bricking Risk** - Incorrect procedures can permanently damage your device. Follow instructions exactly.
:::

## Universal Rooting Process

All Android devices follow this four-step rooting process, regardless of manufacturer or root method.

### Step 1: Unlock Bootloader

Unlocking the bootloader is the essential first step that enables all subsequent modifications.

**Quick Steps:**
1. **Enable Developer Options** (Settings > About > Tap Build Number 7 times)
2. **Enable OEM Unlocking** (Developer Options > OEM Unlocking)
3. **Enable USB Debugging** (Developer Options > USB Debugging)
4. **Boot to fastboot mode** (Power + Volume Down or `adb reboot bootloader`)
5. **Execute unlock command** (`fastboot flashing unlock` or `fastboot oem unlock`)

> [!CAUTION]
> ⚠️ This step erases all data completely.

**[📖 Complete Bootloader Unlocking Guide](./how-to-unlock-bootloader.md)**

### Step 2: Install Custom Recovery

Custom recovery provides advanced features and safer modification workflows. Required for some devices and methods.

**Popular Options:**
- **TWRP** - Most widely supported
- **OrangeFox** - Modern interface
- **SKYHAWK** - Feature-rich

**Process:**
1. **Download device-specific recovery**
2. **Boot to fastboot mode**
3. **Flash recovery image** - `fastboot flash recovery recovery.img`
4. **Boot to recovery** - Test functionality

**[📖 Custom Recovery Installation Guide](./how-to-install-custom-recovery.md)**

### Step 3: Install Root Solution

Choose and install your preferred root method.

#### Option A: Magisk (Recommended)

1. Download latest Magisk APK from [official GitHub](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases)
2. Extract boot.img from your device's stock firmware
3. Patch boot.img using Magisk app

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Device Won't Boot (Bootloop)**

Symptoms: Device stuck on boot logo, constantly rebooting

Solutions:
1. Boot to recovery mode (Power + Volume Up, varies by device)
2. Wipe cache partition
3. Restore from backup if available
4. Flash stock firmware via fastboot
5. Seek help on device-specific XDA forum

**Root Not Detected**

Symptoms: Root checker shows no root, apps can't get superuser access

Solutions:
1. Verify root manager app is installed
2. Check if superuser daemon is running
3. Grant root permission when prompted
4. Reinstall root solution
5. Verify boot image wasn't overwritten

**Banking Apps Not Working**

Symptoms: Apps detect root and refuse to run

Solutions:
1. Enable root hiding in Magisk (DenyList) or KernelSU
2. Install Play Integrity Fix module
3. Hide Magisk app (rename and repackage)
4. Use app isolation (Island, Shelter)
5. Consider alternative banking apps

**OTA Updates Failing**

Symptoms: System updates fail to install

Solutions:
1. Temporarily uninstall root (Magisk: Restore Images)
2. Accept that OTA updates require manual work when rooted
3. Flash full OTA package manually
4. Wait for rooted OTA update method for your device
5. Use custom ROM with built-in OTA support

**Fastboot Not Recognized**

Symptoms: Computer doesn't detect device in fastboot mode

Solutions:
1. Install proper USB drivers (Windows)
2. Try different USB port (USB 2.0 often works better)
3. Use different USB cable (must be data-capable)
4. Disable USB Selective Suspend (Windows)
5. Try different computer if available

### Emergency Recovery

**Factory Reset Protection (FRP)**

If locked out after factory reset:
1. Use previously synced Google account
2. Follow manufacturer FRP bypass methods
3. Flash stock firmware with all partitions
4. Contact manufacturer support if purchased legitimately

**Complete Brick Recovery**

If device won't power on or enter any mode:
1. Try emergency download mode (EDL/9008)
2. Use manufacturer-specific unbrick tools
3. Search XDA for device-specific unbrick guides
4. Professional repair may be necessary

**Prevention Tips:**
- Always keep stock firmware downloaded
- Create regular backups
- Understand your device's emergency modes
- Join device-specific communities for support
