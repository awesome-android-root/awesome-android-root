## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I switch between root methods?**

Yes. Uninstall current method, flash stock boot image, then install new method. Always backup first.

**Which method has best long-term support?**

Magisk has most mature ecosystem. KernelSU development very active. Both good long-term choices.

**Do all modules work on all methods?**

No. Magisk modules may not work on KernelSU/APatch. Check compatibility before installing.

**Which method is safest?**

All safe when installed correctly. KernelSU offers better security isolation architecturally.

**Can I use multiple methods simultaneously?**

No. Only one root method can be active at a time. Will cause conflicts.

**Which has better battery life?**

All have negligible battery impact. Differences are minimal in real-world usage.

**What about SafetyNet?**

SafetyNet deprecated, replaced by Play Integrity. All methods struggle equally with new system.

**Will rooting break my device?**

Not if done correctly. Follow guides carefully, use correct files, maintain backups.
