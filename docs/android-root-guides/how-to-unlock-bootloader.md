## Understanding Bootloaders

The bootloader is your device's startup manager - the first program that runs when powering on, responsible for loading the operating system and enforcing security policies.

### Why Unlock Your Bootloader?

**Unlocking enables:**
- **Custom recovery installation** (TWRP, OrangeFox)
- **Root access** via Magisk, KernelSU
- **Custom ROM installation** (LineageOS, GrapheneOS)
- **Kernel modifications** for performance tuning
- **Advanced system modifications** and tweaks

### Locked vs Unlocked

| Locked Bootloader | Unlocked Bootloader |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Maximum security | Full customization freedom |
| OTA updates work seamlessly | Can install custom ROMs |
| Banking apps work normally | Can install custom recovery |
| Cannot install custom software | Root access possible |
| Limited modification | Warranty void (usually) |

---

## Prerequisites

### ⚠️ Critical Warnings

::: danger IRREVERSIBLE CONSEQUENCES
**Data Erasure** - Unlocking bootloader completely wipes all data. Backup everything before proceeding.

**Warranty Void** - Most manufacturers permanently void warranty. Some devices show permanent unlock warnings.

**Banking Apps** - Many financial apps detect unlocked bootloaders and refuse to work.

**Device Security** - Unlocked bootloaders reduce device security. Physical access can compromise data.
:::

### Essential Requirements

**Hardware**
- Android device with unlockable bootloader
- 50% or higher battery charge
- Quality USB cable (data-capable)
- Computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux)

**Software**
- [Android Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) (ADB/Fastboot)
- Device-specific USB drivers (Windows)
- Manufacturer-specific tools (Mi Unlock Tool, Odin, etc.)

**Knowledge**
- Basic command line usage
- Device model and variant identification
- Ability to follow instructions precisely

### Manufacturer Policy Overview

| Manufacturer | Method | Wait Time | Restrictions | Success Rate |
|--------------|--------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Google Pixel | Fastboot command | None | None | 99% |
| OnePlus | Fastboot command | None | None | 95% |
| Nothing | Fastboot command | None | None | 90% |
| Xiaomi/Redmi/POCO | Mi Unlock Tool | 7-30 days | Mi Account required | 85% |
| Motorola | Unlock code | None | Permanent warning | 80% |
| Samsung | Unofficial (Odin) | None | Exynos only, Knox trips | 60% |
| Huawei | No longer supported | N/A | Impossible since 2018 | 0% |

**Notes:**
- US carrier-locked models (Verizon, AT&T) often cannot unlock bootloader
- Always verify your specific model's unlockability

```bash
sudo apt install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot
```

**Linux (Arch):**
```bash
sudo pacman -S android-tools
```

### Step 4: Install USB Drivers (Windows Only)

Download and install manufacturer-specific drivers:

### Step 5: Test ADB Connection

1. Connect device to computer via USB
2. Select **File Transfer** mode on device
3. Allow USB debugging when prompted (check "Always allow from this computer")
4. Open terminal/command prompt
5. Test connection:

```bash
adb devices
```

Expected output:
```
List of devices attached
1234567890ABCDEF    device
```

If device not listed:
- Reconnect USB cable
- Try different USB port
- Reinstall drivers (Windows)
- Verify USB debugging is enabled

### Step 6: Backup Your Data

**Essential backups:**
- Photos and videos (Google Photos, cloud storage)
- Contacts (Google Contacts sync)
- Messages (SMS Backup & Restore)

## Troubleshooting

### OEM Unlocking Missing or Greyed Out

**Causes:**
- Carrier restriction (permanent)
- FRP (Factory Reset Protection) active
- Device not connected to internet
- Insufficient wait time after initial setup

**Solutions:**
- Connect to WiFi and wait 24-48 hours
- Try mobile data instead of WiFi (or vice versa)
- Remove Google account, factory reset, wait 48 hours
- If carrier device, may be permanently locked

### Fastboot Not Recognized

**Symptoms:** Computer doesn't detect device in fastboot mode

**Solutions:**
- Install proper USB drivers (Windows)
- Try different USB port (USB 2.0 often more reliable)
- Use different USB cable (must support data transfer)
- Boot to fastboot using hardware keys instead of ADB
- Try different computer
- Disable USB Selective Suspend (Windows Power Options)

### "Remote: Not Allowed" Error

**Causes:**
- OEM Unlocking not enabled
- Device doesn't support unlocking
- Carrier restriction

**Solutions:**
- Verify OEM Unlocking is enabled in Developer Options
- Check device compatibility
- Verify not carrier-locked model

### Device Won't Boot After Unlock

**Symptoms:** Stuck on boot logo or bootloop

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 10 minutes (first boot after unlock can be slow)
2. Force restart: Hold Power button 10-15 seconds
3. Boot to recovery and wipe cache
4. Factory reset from recovery
5. Flash stock firmware via fastboot

**Prevention:** Always download stock firmware before unlocking for emergency recovery.

### "Waiting for Device" Message

**Causes:** Fastboot/ADB connection issues

**Solutions:**
- Verify device appears in `fastboot devices` or `adb devices`
- Reinstall USB drivers (Windows)
- Try different USB port
- Use USB 2.0 port instead of USB 3.0
- Disable antivirus temporarily
- Run command prompt as administrator (Windows)

### Unlock Process Interrupted

If power loss or disconnect during unlock:

1. Reboot to fastboot mode
2. Attempt unlock command again
3. If bootloop, flash stock boot.img:
```bash
fastboot flash boot boot.img
fastboot reboot
```
4. If still issues, flash complete stock firmware
