## ROM Selection Guide

### Decision Matrix

| Need | Recommended ROM | Why |
|------|------------------|-----|
| **Maximum privacy** | GrapheneOS (Pixel) | Hardware-backed security, strict app sandboxing, relockable |
| **Privacy + broad app compatibility** | CalyxOS | Privacy defaults with optional Sandboxed Play |
| **Most devices** | LineageOS | Broadest device support, mature updates |
| **Pixel UX** | Pixel Experience / PixelOS | Pixel look-and-feel on non-Pixel devices |
| **Customization** | crDroid / Evolution X | Granular feature set |
| **Lightweight performance** | ArrowOS | Clean, lean builds |

::: warning **GApps notes:**
- LineageOS recommends MindTheGapps; NikGapps also popular.
- OpenGApps is not maintained for the newest Android versions on many devices.
- Many ROMs ship in ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù (no GApps) and ‚Äúwith GApps‚Äù variants. Match to your preference.
:::

### Device Compatibility Check

#### Find your device:
1. [CustomROMBay.org](https://customrombay.org/)
2. [XDA Forums](https://forum.xda-developers.com/)
3. Official ROM websites

#### Verify model/codename:
- Settings ‚Üí About Phone ‚Üí Model
- adb shell getprop ro.product.device (codename)
- fastboot getvar product
- Beware of regional/carrier variants (e.g., SM-G991B ‚â† SM-G991U)
- Xiaomi anti-rollback (ARB) can brick if you flash older firmware ‚Äî always match required base firmware

---

## Installation Process

There are two primary install flows:
- **Recovery-based** (TWRP/OrangeFox/Lineage Recovery) via Install or ADB Sideload
- **Fastboot-based** (images/graphical web installers) ‚Äî common for Pixels/GrapheneOS

### Step 1: Create Complete Backup

#### Backups on modern devices:
- TWRP/OrangeFox NANDroid may not fully support dynamic partitions on every device; verify your recovery‚Äôs backup/restore capability.
- Consider Seedvault (LineageOS), Swift Backup (root), or manual data backups.
- Never wipe persist/modem/EFS; losing these can break Wi‚ÄëFi, sensors, IMEI.

#### Actions:
1. **Boot to recovery**
2. If supported: Recovery ‚Üí Backup ‚Üí Select boot/system/data/vendor (avoid super unless advised)
3. Copy backups to PC or external storage

### Step 2: Download ROM Files

- ROM ZIP/images for your exact device/codename
- GApps (if needed; e.g., MindTheGapps for LineageOS or NikGapps)
- Required firmware/vendor packages (Xiaomi/OnePlus often require specific base firmware)
- Optional: Magisk/KernelSU/APatch, custom kernel, modules

**Verify downloads:**
- Prefer SHA-256 over MD5
- Check release signatures/digests when provided
- Ensure Android version/firmware requirements match your device

### Step 3: Prepare Device

- Transfer ROM and add-ons to device/SD card or prepare to ADB sideload from PC
- Boot to recovery
- On dynamic partition devices, some operations require fastbootd:
  - From bootloader: fastboot reboot fastboot (enters fastbootd)

### Step 4: Wipe / Format

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Loss Warning
Switching ROM families or coming from stock usually requires a full ‚ÄúFormat Data‚Äù (not just factory reset), which erases internal storage. Back up first.
:::

- Factory reset for minor updates/dirty flash (same ROM family)
- Full clean install:
  - In TWRP/OrangeFox: Wipe ‚Üí Format Data (type yes)
  - Advanced Wipe: System, Data, Cache, Dalvik/ART Cache
  - Do NOT wipe persist/modem/EFS

**Note:** Recovery decryption varies by device. If your recovery can‚Äôt decrypt /data, use ADB sideload or external SD/OTG.

### Step 5: Flash Custom ROM

Recovery install (typical):
1. Install ‚Üí Select ROM ZIP ‚Üí Swipe/confirm
2. Immediately flash GApps (if using a vanilla ROM). GApps must be flashed before first boot.
3. Flash add-ons: Magisk (root), KernelSU (kernel-based root), custom kernels, etc.

#### ADB sideload (LineageOS/others):
1. In recovery: Apply Update ‚Üí Apply from ADB
2. On PC: adb sideload rom.zip
3. Then: adb sideload gapps.zip (if needed)
4. Then: adb sideload addons (e.g., Magisk ZIP if supported by your recovery)

#### Fastboot images (Pixel/GrapheneOS/Some ROMs):
- Use the vendor‚Äôs install script or web installer (see ROM-specific section)
- For dynamic partitions, the script may reboot to fastbootd automatically
- Never mix init_boot/boot images incorrectly; follow device-specific docs

#### AVB/vbmeta (advanced):
- Only disable verity/verification if your device/ROM instructions explicitly say so.
- Incorrect vbmeta steps can cause boot failure or brick.

#### A/B slots:
- Generally handled by the installer/recovery. For manual fastboot:
  - fastboot getvar current-slot
  - fastboot set_active a or b
  - Some images support _ab targets (e.g., fastboot flash boot_ab boot.img)

### Step 6: First Boot & Setup

- First boot can take 5‚Äì20 minutes; don‚Äôt interrupt
- Complete setup wizard
- Validate basics: Wi‚ÄëFi, mobile data, calls/SMS, camera, sensors, fingerprint, NFC, Bluetooth, GPS
- For eSIM: activation may be cleared by wipes; check with your carrier before wiping

## ROM-Specific Installation

### GrapheneOS (Pixel Only)

Web Installer method:
1. Visit https://grapheneos.org/install/web
2. Use Chrome/Chromium (WebUSB)
3. Follow the guided process (handles fastboot/fastbootd, images, and slotting)
4. No custom recovery required

Benefits: Maximum security posture, verified boot, hardened toolchain, Sandboxed Google Play (optional)

Bootloader: Can safely relock on GrapheneOS. Do not relock on ROMs that don‚Äôt explicitly support it.

### LineageOS (Most Devices)

Standard method:
1. Download official builds: https://download.lineageos.org/
2. Use Lineage Recovery or TWRP/OrangeFox per device guide
3. ADB sideload recommended by Lineage docs
4. Use MindTheGapps (recommended) or a compatible GApps package if needed
5. Seedvault backup integration available

Benefits: Broad support, stable updates, trustable infrastructure

### Pixel Experience / PixelOS

- Pixel Experience: https://download.pixelexperience.org/
- PixelOS: search official site or XDA thread for your device

Notes:
- Some builds include GApps; others are ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù
- Install via recovery/ADB sideload; follow device thread instructions
- Monthly security patches common

---

## Post-Installation Setup

### Essential Configuration
- Run updates (Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Updater)
- Restore data (Seedvault, Swift Backup, app-native backups)
- Review permissions and privacy settings
- Configure IMS (VoLTE/VoWiFi/5G) if your carrier/ROM supports it

### Privacy Optimization
- Disable telemetry/analytics in ROM and apps
- Private DNS (e.g., dns.adguard.com, 1.1.1.1, NextDNS)
- Consider F-Droid, Obtainium, Aurora Store for privacy-friendly app sourcing
- Use a reputable firewall (e.g., NetGuard) and limit background activity
- Be mindful: aggressive adblocking/VPNs may break push notifications; exclude FCM if needed

### App Installation
- F-Droid ‚Äî open-source apps
- Aurora Store ‚Äî access Play Store without Google account
- APKMirror ‚Äî verify signatures; prefer official dev sources where possible

### Banking/Government Apps
- Many now enforce Play Integrity API (hardware-backed attestation).
- Magisk DenyList helps hide root from selected apps; Shamiko and ‚ÄúPlay Integrity Fix‚Äù modules exist but may violate app ToS and are not guaranteed to work.
- Respect local laws and app ToS. If mission-critical, consider a non-rooted, stock or relockable-secure ROM profile/device.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Installation Issues

#### Bootloop / Stuck on logo:
- Confirm correct ROM for exact codename/variant
- Format Data (not just wipe) if switching ROM families
- Reflash ROM + correct GApps
- Ensure required base firmware/vendor is installed
- Check active slot; try switching slots
- Last resort: restore backup or reflash stock

#### Decryption issues in recovery:
- Use the ROM‚Äôs recovery + ADB sideload
- Remove screen lock before flashing (if safe)
- Update to a recovery build that supports your Android version

#### Missing features (camera/IMS/sensors):
- Flash/update required vendor/firmware package
- Check device thread for proprietary blobs/camera fixes
- IMS provisioning varies; some ROMs include toggle/tools

#### Performance/battery issues:
- Clean flash if coming from a different ROM
- Let the ROM settle 1‚Äì3 charge cycles (indexing)
- Update kernel/ROM; consider a known-stable kernel for your device
- Reduce animations; restrict misbehaving apps

#### Play Integrity/SafetyNet:
- Many custom setups won‚Äôt pass strong integrity. Basic/weak may be achievable.
- Passing strong integrity on unlocked devices is typically not possible by design.

### Recovery Solutions

#### Emergency Recovery:
1. Boot to bootloader/fastboot
2. For dynamic partitions: fastboot reboot fastboot (fastbootd) if needed
3. Flash stock images (Pixel: flash-all; Xiaomi: Mi Flash; Samsung: Odin)
4. Qualcomm EDL (9008) is last resort; research carefully or seek professional help

#### Backup Restoration:
1. Boot to recovery
2. Restore NANDroid (if supported/consistent with current partition layout)
3. Or reflash ROM and restore app data from Seedvault/Swift Backup

## Staying Updated

### Update Strategies

- **Manual updates:**
  - Track official releases/Telegram/XDA/GitHub
  - Dirty flash within same ROM family is usually fine for monthly updates
  - Clean flash for major Android version jumps or when advised

- **OTA updates:**
  - Many ROMs support seamless A/B OTAs
  - LineageOS/Pixel Experience often include an Updater app
  - If using custom recovery, ensure OTA compatibility (virtual A/B may sidestep recovery entirely)
