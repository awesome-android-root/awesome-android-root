## Getting Started

### What is Rooting?

**Rooting grants superuser (su) access** to your Android device, similar to administrator privileges on a PC. It allows apps and scripts to perform system-level operations that are normally restricted.

**What You Can Do:**
- **System Modification:** Remove bloatware, customize UI, install system-wide ad blockers
- **Advanced Backups:** Complete app data backups with Titanium Backup or Swift Backup
- **Automation:** Enhanced Tasker automation with root actions
- **Performance Tuning:** Custom kernels, CPU/GPU governors, memory management
- **Privacy Control:** Firewall apps, per-app permissions, network monitoring
- **Module System:** Install Magisk/KernelSU modules for systemless modifications

**Popular Uses:**
- System-wide ad blocking (AdAway, hosts-based blocking)
- Complete device backups
- Custom recovery and ROM installation
- Removing carrier bloatware
- Advanced theming and customization
- Enhanced privacy controls

### Is Rooting Safe?

**Yes, when done correctly**, but it comes with responsibilities and trade-offs.

**Benefits:**
- Full control over your device
- Remove manufacturer restrictions
- Install powerful customization
- Enhanced privacy and security options (if configured properly)

**Risks:**
- **Warranty:** Most manufacturers void warranty when bootloader is unlocked
- **Data Loss:** Bootloader unlock wipes all data
- **Bricking:** Small risk of soft brick (fixable) or hard brick (rare, if not following guides)
- **Security:** Root access can be exploited by malicious apps if not managed carefully
- **App Compatibility:** Some apps check for root/unlocked bootloader (banking, DRM, mobile payments)

**Permanent Changes:**
- **Samsung KNOX:** Permanently trips to 0x1, cannot be reset
- **Bootloader Unlock:** Some devices record unlock status permanently

- **DNS-based Ad Blocking:** NextDNS, AdGuard DNS (no root)
- **Launcher Customization:** Icon packs, gestures (no root)
- **Work Profile:** Separate work/personal apps with Shelter

**Alternatives Without Root:**
- [Non-Root Alternatives Guide](./non-root-alternatives.md)
- [Android Ad Blocking](./guides/android-adblocking.md)
- [App Debloating Guide](./guides/android-apps-debloating.md)

**Decision Flowchart:**

```
Need system-level modifications? → Yes → Root likely needed
    ↓ No
Can you achieve goal with ADB/Shizuku? → Yes → Try non-root first
    ↓ No
Will you lose critical apps? → Yes → Consider non-root alternatives
    ↓ No
Comfortable troubleshooting? → Yes → Root is viable option
    ↓ No
Research more and ask community
```

### Bootloader and Security

**Q: What is a bootloader?**

The bootloader is the first program that runs when you power on your Android device. It loads the operating system and verifies its integrity.

**Q: Why do I need to unlock the bootloader?**

An unlocked bootloader allows you to:
- Flash custom recovery (TWRP, OrangeFox)
- Install custom ROMs
- Root your device
- Flash modified boot images

**Q: Is unlocking the bootloader safe?**

Yes, but with caveats:
- **Wipes all data** - backup first
- **Voids warranty** on most devices
- **Permanent flags** on some devices (Samsung KNOX)
- **Security implications** - easier for thieves to access data if device is stolen

**Q: Can I lock the bootloader after rooting?**

Generally no, or not recommended:
- Locking with custom software can hard brick your device
- Some ROMs support locking (GrapheneOS, CalyxOS)
- Always flash stock firmware before locking

- [OEM Unlock Policies by Manufacturer](./android-root-guides/how-to-unlock-bootloader.md#oem-unlock-policies)

---

### Understanding Android Partitions

**Q: What's the difference between boot.img and init_boot.img?**

| Partition | Used On | Contains | When to Patch |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **boot.img** | Android 12 and older | Kernel + Ramdisk | Older devices |
| **init_boot.img** | Android 13+ (GKI 2.0) | Ramdisk only | Pixel 7/8/9, newer devices |

**Important:** Patching the wrong image won't root your device!

**Q: What are A/B partitions?**

Modern devices use A/B (seamless) update system:
- Two sets of partitions (slot A and slot B)
- System updates install to inactive slot
- If update fails, device boots from working slot
- Enables updates without downtime

**Q: What is vbmeta and AVB?**

- **AVB (Android Verified Boot):** Security feature that verifies system integrity
- **vbmeta partition:** Contains verification metadata
- **dm-verity:** File-level verification system

**Modern Magisk typically doesn't require disabling AVB.** Only disable if your specific ROM/kernel requires it.

---

### OTA Updates and Root

**Q: Can I receive OTA updates after rooting?**

**With Magisk (A/B devices):**
- Yes, using "Install to Inactive Slot (After OTA)" feature
- Process:
  1. Download OTA via system updater (don't reboot)
  2. Open Magisk → Install → "Install to Inactive Slot"
  3. Reboot when Magisk finishes
  4. Root preserved on new version

**With Magisk (non-A/B devices):**
- Must unroot, apply OTA, then re-root
- Or manually flash new firmware and re-patch

**With KernelSU/APatch:**
- Must manually flash compatible kernel after OTA
- Or wait for kernel update for new firmware version

**Q: Will OTA break root?**

- Magisk A/B: No, if you use correct method
- Other scenarios: Yes, OTA replaces boot partition

**Learn More:**
- [OTA Update Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md#ota-update-problems)

## Compatibility

### Will My Apps Still Work?**

**Most apps work fine,** but some categories check for root or unlocked bootloader:

**Apps That Usually Work:**
- Social media (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook)
- Messaging (WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal)
- Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Brave)
- Entertainment (YouTube, Spotify, most games)
- Productivity apps

**Apps That May Have Issues:**
- Banking and financial apps
- Mobile payment (Google Pay, Samsung Pay)
- DRM streaming (Netflix in some regions)
- Corporate/enterprise apps with MDM
- Games with anti-cheat (Pokemon GO, Call of Duty Mobile)

**Mitigation:**
- Use Magisk DenyList to hide root from specific apps
- Configure Zygisk for advanced hiding
- Install modules like Shamiko, Play Integrity Fix
- Keep apps updated
- Clear app data after configuring hiding

**Reality Check:** Some apps with hardware-backed attestation (STRONG Play Integrity) cannot be fooled on unlocked bootloaders.

---

### Can I Use Banking Apps?

**It depends on the app and your configuration.**

**Current Status (2025):**
- **Play Integrity BASIC:** Often passable with proper configuration
- **Play Integrity DEVICE:** Sometimes passable
- **Play Integrity STRONG:** Typically fails on unlocked bootloader (hardware-backed)

**To Improve Compatibility:**

1. **Configure root hiding properly:**
   - Enable Zygisk in Magisk
   - Add banking apps to DenyList
   - Hide Magisk app (rename it)

2. **Clear app data:**
   ```
   Settings → Apps → [Banking App] → Storage → Clear Data
   Settings → Apps → Google Play Services → Clear Cache
   Reboot device
   ```

3. **Check device certification:**
   - Play Store → Settings → About
   - Should show "Device is certified"

4. **Test before relying on it:**
   - Don't root if banking app is critical and you haven't verified it works

**Alternative Solutions:**
- Use browser-based banking (usually works)
- Keep a secondary non-rooted device for banking
- Use work profile with non-rooted user profile

**We don't provide methods to bypass app security.** These are legitimate compatibility steps only.
